# sulla

> Sulla is a javascript library which provides a high-level API control to Whatsapp so it can be configured to automatize resposes or any data that goes trough Whatsapp effortlessly.
>
> It is built using [puppeteer](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer) and based on [this python wrapper](https://github.com/mukulhase/WebWhatsapp-Wrapper)

## Installation

```bash
> npm i sulla
```

## Usage

```javascript
// import { create, Whatsapp } from 'sulla';
const sulla = require('sulla');

sulla.create().then(client => start(client));

function start(client) {
  client.onMessage(message => {
    if (message.body === 'Hi') {
      client.sendText(message.from, 'ðŸ‘‹ Hello from sulla!');
    }
  });
}
```

###### After executing `create()` function, **sulla** will create an instance of whatsapp web. If you are not logged in, it will print a QR code in the [terminal](https://i.imgur.com/g8QvERI.png). Scan it with your phone and you are ready to go!

###### sulla will remember the session so there is no need to authenticate everytime.
